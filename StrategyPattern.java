/**
 * We separate behaviors to their own interface, and have class implementations of that behavior.
 * Then when fighters want to use a certain behavior, they can be set within the ctor.
 *
 * ~~ Design Principle ~~
 * Identify the aspects of your application
 * that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
 *
 * ~~ OO Principles ~~
 * - Encapsulate what varies -> Jump and Roll Behavior
 * - Favor Composition over inheritance -> Forward/Backward Jump, Forward/Backward Roll
 * - Program to the interface, not the implementaion -> JumpBehavior jumpBehavior = new ForwardJump()
 *
 *  Finally, let's incorporate dynamic behavior changes.
